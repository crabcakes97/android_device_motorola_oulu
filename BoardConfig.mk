# Root: stock init_boot ramdisk on this device is already KernelSU-patched
# (init.real backup + kernelsu.ko present) - informational only, does not
# affect the TWRP build.

# servicemanager, keystore2 and the other bootstrap binaries have
# /system/bin/bootstrap/linker64 as their ELF interpreter. If it is missing,
# execv fails with ENOENT (reported against the binary, not the interpreter),
# binder never comes up and the recovery service crash-loops.
#
# v3-v5 created this at runtime from init.recovery.mt6878.rc's "on early-init".
# In v6 that stopped taking effect and TWRP crash-looped, so do not depend on a
# trigger firing: bake the symlink into the ramdisk at build time.
# The security patch level the TEE expects. The Trustonic KeyMint HAL reads
# exactly two properties - ro.build.version.security_patch and
# ro.vendor.build.security_patch - and binds keys to them. The recovery
# ramdisk's prop.default carries the AOSP defaults for this branch
# (2024-09-05, and an EMPTY vendor value), which do not match the firmware on
# the device. The mismatch makes HAL_Configure() fail with
# "TlcKM: Failed to read version info.", after which every KeyMint call returns
# Invalid session handle and keystore2 reports -49
# SECURE_HW_COMMUNICATION_FAILED - so /data cannot be decrypted at all.
#
# Must match the running firmware: read it off the device with
#     getprop ro.vendor.build.security_patch      (or /vendor/build.prop)
# UPDATE THIS AFTER EVERY OTA, or decryption will stop working.
# android.hardware.gatekeeper-V1-ndk has no recovery variant in Soong, so it is
# built and installed only to system/lib64 and never reaches the ramdisk. Both the
# recovery binary (which links it via TW_INCLUDE_CRYPTO) and the Trustonic
# gatekeeper HAL need it at runtime: without it the HAL dies with
# "CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE ... library android.hardware.gatekeeper-V1-ndk.so not
# found" and exits status 1 forever, so CE storage can never be unlocked.
# Do NOT take this .so from the device's system partition - that one is built
# against keymint-V4 while this branch ships keymint-V3, and it drags the wrong
# ABI in behind it. The copy below is the one this tree built.

# libtar.so is also never refreshed in the ramdisk: a rebuilt copy lands in
# system/lib64 and the intermediates, but recovery/root/system/lib64 silently keeps
# whatever the first build put there. Every libtar fix was therefore absent from
# the flashed image - found when a fixed Data-backup crash reproduced byte-for-byte
# and the packed libtar.so turned out to be months old. Copy it in explicitly.
# If you change anything under bootable/recovery/libtar, verify the ramdisk copy's
# sha256 matches obj/SHARED_LIBRARIES/libtar_intermediates/libtar.so.
